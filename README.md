# Google Books Search

### Business Value
 Using the Google Books API, application can perform full-text searches and retrieve book information. Customers can also save favorite books. 


### Future Development 

* React routing and [socket.io](http://socket.io) to create a notification or a component that triggers whenever a user saves an book. Your message should include the title of the saved book.

  * Say user has multiple browsers open, each one visiting your site. If you save an book in one browser, then all of your browsers should notify you that a new book was saved.

  * [Socket.io NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io)
